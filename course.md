  - A Report on my 5yo Elon's progress the past six month. He got all the freedom to do whatever he wants, except beening required to sit down to draw whatever he wanted every night. And I would ask him to help a bit with my projects, just as I help him with his cooking/woodwork projects. but he got all the freedom to decide whatever he wants to build, I only offer the material he wants. His days have been mostly youtube, surprisingly, even without any supervision, he preferred educational content, e.g Blippi, The Monkey Gorge, Steve and Maggie, and Peppa Pig. and gave up things like Tom and Jerry. To conclude, his days are fairly efficient and happy, he got to make all his decisions, cause I believe it's the best way to develop his passion for learning. Self confidence and self significance matter. Yeah, still 100% #EnglishOnly , #projectBasedLearning. thx.

  
- 20230701-20230831
  - continue OneDrawingOneDay, and Elon will take charge of his own day plan, he started to dump stupid videos, and perferred more educational one's like Youtue:WildBrainFizz.
  - my role is mostly 1hr per day, playing with him, I don't really push for anything.
- 20230530-20230630
  - start OneDrawingOneDay for Elon, I think I need to pause this after 1 month, cause I don't want to push him too much, we will switch to music or sth, and then come back a few month later for drawing.
  - added a math/logic lesson everyday, so now Elon is required to do 1hr of study, my goal is too make it to 3hr or more a day, but without any pain. Our goal as parents is just to help Elon to do self-guided-learning.
- 20230425-20230530
  - adopted the 'ConsciousParent' approach, try not to force him to do anything
    - I've foucusing on setup connections with him, and helping him connect with himself. no yelling, no forcing, building self significance.
  - Elon has made great progress in term of lanuage acqusition
- 20230418-25
  - I start my new rutine tag #babyEnglishOnly, meaning I only shadow child English.
  - kinda fall into the belif of PlayingIstheBestLearning , try to keep eveything as natrual and enjoyable for Elon as possible. only one Khan lesson every day, almost no shadowing.
  - but he is making marvelous progress, I saw him telling stories to Billie for 5 mins or so. and I realized all it matters is his curiosity and passion to express. So protecting those are my top priority.
