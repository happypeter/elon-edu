## 0011 speaking first
learning does not lead to acquisition. A non academic approach is a must here. From Rachel's English, i learnt the idea of pronounciation reduction. this happens to all of the most common words, that means if u try to hard to practice the IPA of a word, that may harm ur speaking. real english is simply different. it is to flexsible to be learned from a school approach. this makes me more convinced that the Natural Approach is the right way to go. so Elon will just learn from real conversations which means 5hr youtube plus 2hr of shandowing. no hurry to learn words, cause oral language is not about words, but sound groups. babies do not need to know how to read to talk well. when Elon learns a scentence I wont even require hime to speak every sound, he can be unclear at the begining. the whole point is still knowing what to say under certain context.
