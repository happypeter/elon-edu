## 0001 Speaking Before Reading
learn how to read and write at the same time was a mistake, will focus on speaking first for a year or so.

## 0002 Phonics does not help picking up the language
English or any language ablity is your natural voice reaction in certain context. reading could be a powerful tool for human, but that's sth else. binding sound chunks to contexts does not need the ablity to read, and thus Phonics is not needed before Elon can speak the language fluently.

## 0003 Send Iphone Photoes to Macbook
use AirDrop

## 0004 Vacabulary Building
no notes, no vacabulary book, only use dictionary in ergent cases, and mostly for pronouciation, not meaning. Learn by extensive reading.

## 0005 Math/Logic/Phonics Progress
No hurry, follow the pace of Khan Academy Kids

## 0006  Manage to the Dopamine
Don't manage Elon's time, manage his dopamine. Even you can keep them stay in your class for most of time, as long as he watch 3hr very entertaining cartoon, you plan won't work.

## 0007 Phonics, Always Map To the 44
use slow shandowing to practice Phonics is a wonderful way to improve the English. Always pause and check to map the 44 sounds to 100+ common combinations is hugely enabling.

## 0008 Letter Sounds Before Spelling
Before you teach baby spelling, make sure they know letter sounds. Just the phonics way to remember spelling.

## 0009 Curriculum Evolution
I don't design the courses, they will evolve natrually. I am open to all the piradigms, and I pick what fit. Having a Knowledge Map is nice but that is not designed but evolved into overtime. Every subjects should be learnt with A Natrual Approach.

## 0010 Shandowing/ShandowReading
Optimize for happiness. Elon got to pick whatever content he wants, the difficuty level does not matter. Try not to teach, but keep communicating with him to share the joy. Don't worry about the amount of reading, keep him relaxed. As long as he is passionate about the content, it's all fine.

## 0011 speaking first
Learning does not lead to acquisition. A non academic approach is a must. From Rachel's English, i learned the idea of pronounciation reductions. which happen to all of the most common words, that means if u try to hard to practice the IPA of a word, that may harm ur speaking. real english is simply different. it is too flexsible to be learned from a academic approach. this makes me more convinced that the Natural Approach is the only right way to go. so Elon will just learn from real conversations which means 5hr youtube plus 2hr of shandowing. no hurry to learn words, cause oral language is not about words, but sound groups. babies do not need to know how to read to talk well. when Elon learns a scentence I wont even require hime to speak every sound, he can be unclear at the begining. the whole point is binding a sound group to certain real life contexts, the abilty of reading does not help with accelerating the process. 


## 0012 Don't think, bind
learning English is just binding a notation, be it sounds or letters, to a thing. It is stupid to overthink, when people say good morning, they are not talking about if the morning is good or bad, that just means hello. Don't ask why people say I gonna go rather than I m off. Follow people's habits makes u more understandable, that is it. So as a English learner, don't think of any rules, think of norms. Think What's the most common way to express ur idea under this context. So all it matters is enough Comprehensive Input. Don't overthink, don't translate from ur mother tongue, just be curious and try to copy the native speakers.

## 0013 Don't read, shadow 
reading Aloud just solidify ur own pronunciation flaws, you can not tell the reductions, additions or contradictions from printed text, even you got all the IPA perfectly. U will still sound like a book and don't know how to talk. So have ur goal clear, if u want to converse, don't shadow speeches.

## 0014 Forget about IPA
thinking of IPA of a word, does not help with my listening or speaking at all, if you think of pronunciation rules, u can not speak, speaking ability comes from direct binding from sound groups to things, so yes, Phonics does not help either here, it might be a good way for kids learning to read, but it has nothing to do with speaking n listening, i used to worry about imitation only doesn't guarantee correctness of pronunciation, sure this is true for me, but also a 3yo American baby, so apparently one doesn't need IPA or phonics to improve pronunciations. It just grow naturally along the way, when u try to sound like the people u love, or try to avoid confusions, so my future plan is simply doing the shadowing, whenever i doubt my pronouncing, don't turn to a dictionary and check IPA, just keep going. It might work to compare two similar words, say boot and book, or maybe it's just stupid wasting ur time thinking, ask urself, do babies do 

## 0015 no text, learn with ears
Does a baby need subtitles to learn speaking? No. Forget about spelling, phonics and the 44 sounds, just do the shadowing. Native speaker learn English with their ears, while we learn with eyes, that is the main reason we can not speak. English is about syllables not words.

### 0016 forget spelling, focus on syllables
When I was listening a simple video just now, I found myself reflecting the spellings along the way. While more importantly I should have focused on the pronunciation details.  Jake from Yemen told me you don’t need to know all the details to speak, the lesson I learned is that, not only spelling, even the pronunciation of a sentence doesn’t needed to be fully mastered, my attention is limited, focus on what truly important to make my speaking understandable. Which should be the stressed syllables and intonation stuff.

### 0017 start from fast

When it comes to learn spoken English, it is wise to start shadowing fast English, not slow one! Real life English and school English, even they are both spoken by native speakers, r two different language. The counterintuitive fact is that the more u learn the slow English, the harder u can switch to the fast one. Even u r comfortable with ‘I am going to’,  ‘IMNA’ is still sth u need to learn. So if it is not for reading which definitely should be learned after u can speak, learning the slow version is not just wasting ur time, but also cause slowing down and confusion. Stop shadowing audio books, turn to sth real like Blippi. Just because I feel it is fast n difficult, doesn’t mean it is difficult for Elon. Seriously, IMNA Is a whole lot easier than IAMGOINGTO.

### 0018 DonT learn English with leveled readers
Cuz books like RAZ were designed for kids who already know English, to learn reading. Again, a language is learned by ears not eyes. This is so so important, yet few teachers understand this in China. Note, even the audio of the RAZ books r there to help kids learn the words, not speaking. So stop shadowing Khan Academy or RZA books

### 0019 babyEnglishOnly
this is for myself. I find it hard to pick up the sounds when I shandow too much adult level english, my energy used a lot on the content itself. Child cartoon things will be good for me now, with limited difficulty level, simpler logic and vocabulary. I can foucus on the intonation. This is also very NATRUAL, think what Elon would do if I throw him a ted talk, he will go away.
